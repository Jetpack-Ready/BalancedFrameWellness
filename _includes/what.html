<h1 class="display-3">Chiropractic</h1><p>Chiropractic care is a system of care rooted in the belief that our bodies are self-healing organisms. Based on scientific study, the body is subtly manipulated at the joints to move towards better alignment and overall function. The structure of the spine and the function of the nervous system are the primary focus as we look at whole body wellness. </p><p>In addition to the subtle manipulation of joints, Dr. Margaret Ready is also trained in myofascial release, adhesion release, kinesiology taping, functional dry needling, and ergonomic education.</p><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4"><div class="card"><div class="card-header">Mobility and Flexibility</div><img src="/assets/img/client_arm.jpg" alt="Margaret stretches a patient's arm, mobilizing chest, shoulder, and back muscles" class="card-img-bottom img-fluid"/></div></div><div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4"><div class="card"><div class="card-header">Functional Dry Needling</div><img src="/assets/img/client_fdn.jpg" alt="Margaret guides a patient's head while massaging shoulder muscles with her elbow" class="card-img-bottom img-fluid"/></div></div><div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4"><div class="card"><div class="card-header">Relaxation and Healing</div><img src="/assets/img/client_neck.jpg" alt="Margaret performs functional dry needling on a patient's shoulder" class="card-img-bottom img-fluid"/></div></div></div><h2>Prenatal Chiropractic</h2><p>Chiropractic care is safe at any stage of pregnancy, and Dr. Ready has the experience and tools necessary to ensure safety and comfort for all patients. In addition to the aforementioned services, Dr. Ready practices the Webster technique.</p><p>The Webster technique is utilized to correct spinal, pelvic and sacral dysfunction. This technique allows for proper baby positioning, improved comfort during pregnancy, and reduced pain and labor time.</p><h6>How Does it Work?</h6><p>This technique works by relieving tension on the muscles and ligaments that surround the pelvis. When tension is released, the pelvis can maintain optimal function and reduce any torsion (twisting of the uterus) that may affect the baby. Torsion can prevent the baby from comfortably assuming the best possible position for birth.</p><h6>What are the benefits?</h6><li>Greater comfort</li><li>Proper baby positioning</li><li>Reduced labor time</li><li>Less painful delivery</li><h2>Pediatric Chiropractic</h2><p>The gentle approach to correcting misalignments in the spine that may affect your childâ€™s overall health that Dr. Ready employs means it is safe for all ages. Even newborns can benefit from small corrections after birth and throughout their early years.</p><p>Spinal dysfunction can be present from in utero mal positioning, birth trauma, or the minor slips and falls that accompany childhood. Having your child regularly adjusted will allow them to function and grow with a healty spine free of any joint, muscular or neurologic dysfunction.</p><p>Dr. Ready can help infants with a variety of needs including birth trauma, torticollis, pelvic dysfunction, constipation and colic.</p>
