p We are Denver. We are a city of active individuals who enjoy playing hard as well as our down time watching glorious sunsets while sipping suds. Whether you drink kombucha or something stronger we are here to help your body reset to maintain your active lifestyle. 

p A Balanced Frame Wellness operates from a whole body perspective to support you with chiropractic care, dry needling, taping, and rolling as we continue to add modalities with our partners that work for your unique whole person.

p Dr. Margaret Ready established Balanced Frame at its current location in 2016 after reconciling why she was splitting her time with clients between a mother-centered space and a high-intensity gym. The common interest of her clients is maintaining a high-functioning lifestyle whether it is helping to realign pelvic girdles or provide support for recovering muscles.
