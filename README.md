# BalancedFrameWellness
Developing a succinct, practical site for a chiropractic and wellness business.

# Process
I'm trying out a new development environment, using the [Design + Code](https://github.com/travisneilson/Design-Code) series that [Travis Neilson](http://travisneilson.com/) created for DevTips. Here's the [excellent playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KeBN2krBtcO3U90_7SOl-A)

# Environment
  1. Jekyll
  2. Jade
  3. SASS
  4. Autoprefixer
  5. Browser Sync
  6. Gulp (Node.JS)
  7. Twitter Bootstrap 4 (alpha 5)

# Replicating This Environment
A lot of this was already handled by Github user shakyShane in the README.md of his [jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync](https://github.com/shakyShane/jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync) repository. You can even watch a [video](quick.as/pvrslgx) about it!
Go start there, but I'll replicate it here.

  1. Install Jekyll - `$ gem install jekyll`
  2. NodeJS - download and install
  3. GulpJS - `$ [sudo] npm install -g gulp`
  4. Use the Bootstrap CDN

# Next Steps
* Add photography
* Lay out the footer
* Replace Bootstrap CDN with SASS files to modify variables (especially color)

# Latest Review
1. New copy provided by Kia
2. New photography provided by Kia
3. Simplified content

# First review meeting
1. Title: Balanced Frame
   Subtitle: Chiropractic and Wellness Center
2. Margarety will do a copy review and provide better words
3. Figure out how to make sure she's coming up in maps and stuff for "chiropractor" "massage" "functional dry needling" "webster certified"
4. Learn about buying packages through Square and track visits/appointments etc
5. Learn about scheduling, payments, dealing with cash, etc
