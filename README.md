# BalancedFrameWellness
Developing a succinct, practical site for a chiropractic and wellness business.

# Process
I'm trying out a new development environment, using the [Design + Code](https://github.com/travisneilson/Design-Code) series that [Travis Neilson](http://travisneilson.com/) created for DevTips. Here's the [excellent playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KeBN2krBtcO3U90_7SOl-A)

# Environment

  1. Jekyll
  2. Jade
  3. SASS
  4. Autoprefixer
  5. Browser Sync
  n. Gulp (Node.JS)

# Replicating This Environment
A lot of this was already handled by Github user shakyShane in the README.md of his [jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync](https://github.com/shakyShane/jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync) repository. You can even watch a [video](quick.as/pvrslgx) about it!
Go start there, but I'll replicate it here.

  1. Install Jekyll - `$ gem install jekyll`
  2. NodeJS - download and install
  3. GulpJS - `$ [sudo] npm install -g gulp`
