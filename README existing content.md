# Chiropractic Care
Chiropractic adjustments are performed by applying manipulation to a joint that has abnormal movement patterns or fails to function normally. The goal of a chiropractic adjustment is to correct structural alignment and improve the body's physical function.

All of the techniques listed below can complement your spinal adjustment, help relieve pain, and help improve overall health and function:
- Myofascial Release
- Adhesion Release
- Kinesiology Taping
- Dry Needling
- Exercise and Ergonomic Education

Dr. Ready can help patients suffering from acute and chronic sports injury, back pain, nerve pain, headaches, TMJ dysfunction, sinus issues and many other musculoskeletal complaints.

## Functional Dry Needling
A therapeutic treatment procedure that involves multiple advances of a filament needle into the muscle in the area of the body which produces pain and typically contains a trigger point. The intent is to cause the muscle to contract and then release, often referred to as a “twitch response,” improving overall flexibility of the muscle and decreasing symptoms. Dry needling is an effective treatment for acute and chronic pain, rehabilitation from injury, and even pain and injury prevention. This technique is unequaled in finding and eliminating neuromuscular dysfunction that leads to pain and functional deficits.

# Prenatal Chiropractic
Webster Technique

Dr. Ready practices the Webster technique, which is utilized to correct spinal, pelvic and sacral dysfunction. This technique allows for proper baby positioning, improved comfort during pregnancy, and reduced pain and labor time.

How Does it Work?
This technique works by relieving tension on the muscles and ligaments that surround the pelvis. When tension is released, the pelvis can maintain optimal function and reduce any torsion (twisting of the uterus) that may affect the baby. Torsion can prevent the baby from comfortably assuming the best possible position for birth.

How Will I Lay Down?
Dr. Ready has specialized pillows and tools to provide expectant moms with optimal comfort during treatment!

Benefits
- Proper Baby Positioning
- Improved Pregnancy Discomfort
- Reduced Pain
- Reduced Labor Time

# Pediatric Chiropractic
Pediatric chiropractic care takes a gentle approach to correcting misalignments in the spine that may affect your child’s overall health. Dr. Ready offers light touch chiropractic care for all children, including newborns.

## Benefits
Spinal dysfunction can be present from in utero mal positioning, birth trauma, or the minor slips and falls that accompany childhood. Having your child regularly adjusted will allow them to function and grow with a healty spine free of any joint, muscular or neurologic dysfunction.

## Infants
Dr. Ready can help infants with a variety of needs including birth trauma, torticollis, pelvic dysfunction, constipation and colic.

Chiropractic care is safe and effective for children of all ages.
